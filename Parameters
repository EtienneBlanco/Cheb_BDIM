// 0 -> none
// 1 -> the integral of D_g(x)+D_S(x) is set to 1

//The initial distribution is defined as a sum of narrow Gaussian with the following coefficients :
C_g0 = 1 //for the gluon distribution

C_NS0 = 0 //for the quark non-singlet distribution
//these coefficients are useful only if evo = 1,

//Each Gaussian has the following width :

//This way, you can mimic an initial gluon jet using C_g0=1, C_S0=C_NS0=0...
